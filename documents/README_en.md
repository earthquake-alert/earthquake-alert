    ## tl;dr

    - Obtains earthquake information from the Japan Meteorological Agency, National Research Institute for Earth Science and Disaster Prevention, and others, and sends the formatted information to various platforms such as SNS.
    - Create seismic intensity distribution maps.

    ## 📢 Transmittable platforms

    - Discord (server web hook)
    - Slack (Slack bot)
    - LINE (LINE notify)
    - Twitter API

    ## 💬 Detailed specifications

    - For seismic intensity bulletins, only template-applied images are available. For information on the epicenter and seismic intensity, template-applied images and seismic intensity distribution maps will be sent.
    - The "minimum seismic intensity to be sent" and "target area" can be specified separately for multiple platforms.
    - No other dependencies need to be installed at the time of deployment because everything runs on Docker.

    ## 🚀 Move it.

    **Git and Docker must be installed. **

    Be sure to download via git.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/earthquake-alert/earthquake-alert.git
    ```

    Check the version of [chrome-driver](#-about chrome-driver) and optionally change it to the one that supports the latest version of Chrome.

    ```bash
    # update submodules
    sh build/init_submodule.sh

    # run
    docker-compose up -d

    # Check logs
    docker-compose logs -f

    # pause docker-compose
    docker-compose stop

    # restart
    docker-compose up -d

    # stop (also remove containers)
    docker-compose down
    ````

    ## ⚠ About chrome driver

    Chrome gets the latest version when it is built. Therefore, chrome-driver must always be the right version for the latest version of Chrome. \ \
    Copy the download link for the chrome-driver corresponding to the latest version from the following site and copy [Dockerfile](./Dockerfile)e and change the link in **ADD** in the `install ChromeDriver` section.

    [Index of chrome-driver](https://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/index.html)

    ## 📝 How to write a configuration file

    The configuration file is synchronized with the Docker container. \
    If you want to add a new configuration, please pause it with `docker-compose stop` before adding it. \
    Any new additions or changes will first have the configuration sent to each platform.
